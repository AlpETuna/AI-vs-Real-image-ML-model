Project I made using Tensorflow, using 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessandrasala79/ai-vs-human-generated-dataset


download the train_data and train.csv and unzip in the same folder.


download model at <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GymQxa6SsHcPfrGJhqM8HGg44tpUGJ0k/view?usp=sharing> or:
  run the 2 wrangle python files to put in the ML ready form
  run the training.py to get the ML model 

finally using the modelInput file change the input in the example
